Monetize your blog with Bounce.cc, and make money from User Generated Content and your Own Blog Posts!

== Description ==

Monetize your blog with Bounce.cc, and make money from User Generated Content and your Own Blog Posts!

This plugin will transform all external links, posted by you and your users, by converting them into commissionable (Revenue Sharing) links. Visitors who click these links will be transported transparently to the destination of the original link, but it will be rewritten to take advantage of any affiliate program you are signed up for through the Bounce service. And because it does this “on-the-fly”, both your new and old content, as well as all of the comments on your blog can be monetized. This plugin was custom built for the [Bounce.cc](http://bounce.cc/ "Monetize your site with Bounce!") web service and requires an account there to take full advantage of what this plugin has to offer.

More info and support for this plugin can be found on the [Bounce site](http://bounce.cc/ "Monetize your site with Bounce!").

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin to work with your Bounce account or sign up for the service directly from wp-admin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this require an account with Bounce.cc? =

Yes it does. However, the plugin will allow you to create your account directly from wp-admin if you aren't already a member. Bounce accounts are totally free.

= How does it work? =

All external links are processed through the Bounce service. If the system detects a link that can be converted into a revenue sharing link it will. You can configure which services you are signed up for (Amazon Associates, etc) on the [Bounce.cc](http://bounce.cc/ "Monetize your site with Bounce!") web site.

The plugin works automatically so you don't have to encode each link yourself, and also works for links posted in comments too, helping you monetize the contributions of your users.

= Where can I go for support? =

Visit the [Bounce.cc](http://bounce.cc/ "Monetize your site with Bounce!") web site for more information and support options.
